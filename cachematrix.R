## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. 
## For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = numeric()) {
  s <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() s
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}

##cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
##then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  s <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(s)
  s
}

# example
#  m<-matrix(rnorm(200),5,5)
#  cacheSolve(makeCacheMatrix(m))
